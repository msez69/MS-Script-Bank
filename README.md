- All script names must be the same as previously posted in past versions
- All changable value in scripts must be changed to "%arg" followed by a number, such as "%arg1"
- Tags must be added to the script if needed (**//not working** for not working scripts, **//auto bans** for autobannable scripts, and **//override** to load the script into the trainer regardless if it works or not)
